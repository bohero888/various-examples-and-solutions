The outlook component is simply a collection of TPanels, TToolBars and TToolButtons.

To put the compound component on your palette:
1. select all the components
2. Click on (menu) Component - Create Component Template...
3. Give your component a name
4. Select the palette Tab
5. Select an icon (actually a BMP)
6. You're done.

Note: If you want to add more OutLook Panels (i.e. a TToolBar, TToolButton and TPanel):
1. Copy one of the TToolBars
2. Paste it onto the underlying panel
3. Move the new TToolBar to the bottom of the panel
4. Copy one of the TPanels
5. Paste it onto the underlying panel
6. Move the new TPanel to the bottom of the panel
**IMPORTANT** You have to keep all the components in the same order (top to bottom) that they were created in, otherwise the component will not work right.
