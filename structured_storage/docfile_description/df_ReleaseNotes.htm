<h2><u>Delphi 3's _Release</u></h2>
<p>

As I've said there is no need to call _Release in Delphi 3. Calling it will probably
cause your app to crash.  I've also said that this "auto-release" its a great addition
to Delphi. It is however important to remember that Delphi 3 is not psychic,  maybe version
4.0... ?
<p>

The point is that there are times when you will need to be sure that Delphi has freed
a storage / stream.  This is done easily enough, set the stream / storage variable
to <b>nil</b>.

<pre><font color="#0000FF">
   <font color="#FFFFFF">{stor is a variable of type IStorage}</font>

   stor := blablabla; <font color="#FFFFFF">//Open storage here</font>

   <font color="#FFFFFF">(* Use storage *)</font>

      <font color="#FFFFFF">{Make sure that the storage is released}</font>
   stor := nil;

</font></pre>
