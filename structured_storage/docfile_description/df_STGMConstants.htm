<h2><u>STGM Constants</u></h2>
<p>

If you take a look at the help file, you'll see that there are
quite a few STGM constants. I'll only discuss the ones used in this
article and one or two of general interest.<br>

<table border=1>
	<tr>
		<td>STGM_WRITE</td>
		<td>Write only access</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>STGM_READ</td>
		<td>Read only access</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>Read &amp; Write Access</td>
	</tr>

	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>STGM_SHARE_DENY_NONE</td>
		<td>Don't deny subsequent access</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>STGM_SHARE_DENY_READ</td>
		<td>Deny subsequent read access</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>STGM_SHARE_DENY_WRITE</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>

	</tr>

	<tr>

		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>

	</tr>

	</tr>
	<tr>

		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
