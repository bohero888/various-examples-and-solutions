<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>

A while ago I needed to design a file format for my application.
So after giving it a bit of thought I created what at the time
seemed like the perfect file format for my app...  All was
going well until I needed to sore additional information in the
file. Oops, this I had not planned for. So I had to sit down 
and again design a new format, this time allowing for additional
data at a later stage.  This file format works and is flexible but it is
still not flexible enough.
<p>

I am sure something similar has happened to you.  Some time or
another you must have found a file format a bit limiting.  Would
it not be nice if there was a powerful  and flexible way of saving
data.  Why not go for  powerful, flexible and easy  (ok, ok.. relatively easy ;-)?
<p>

Well, there is.  Structured Storage.  <br>
A Structured Storage file is also called a DocFile or an OLE compound
file. I'll use these terms interchangeably throughout this article.

DocFiles have many features that make them a valuable tool.
For example
<ul>
	<li>Load &amp; Save only portions of the file. Ie No need to load
       the whole thing to get hold of some block of data. ie  Incremental
       access. 
	</li>
	<li>DocFiles are supported internally by Windows,  there are ways
		 to store info about the DocFile, within the DocFile itself.  To
       see this in action, view the properties of a WinWord or Excel
       File in explorer.  The info on the summary and statistics pages
       is read from the DocFile.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
Microsoft has said that Structured Storage will be the default
file format in future editions of windows. The MS-Office products are already
using structured storage. So learning it now will give you a head start.<br>

<u><b>So what are DocFiles?</b></u>
<p>
The best way to think of a DocFiles is as having a file system
within a file.  What that means is that a DocFile can contain
&quot;directories&quot; and &quot;files&quot;.
<p>

For example a DocFile say  Example.ole could contain<br>
<p>
<img src="Graphics/Basic_DocFile_Tree.gif" width=99 height=110 alt=" ">

<p>
Each "file" is separate from the other. You just open a "file" and
work with it, without opening or affecting any of the other "files"
in the DocFile.

<u><b>Some Terminology</b></u>
<p>

<table border=1>
   <tr>
		<td>Storage</td>
		<td>Equivalent of a directory, within the DocFile</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Stream</td>
		<td>Equivalent of a file in a DocFile.  A stream exists in a storage just as a file exists in a directory.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
