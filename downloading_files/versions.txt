v0.9.3.2 - 2002/06/26

This is a bug fix release and contains no new features. The bug fixes are:

Proxy issues
-----------
Some people were reporting an error message on startup regarding
ProxyEnable after which the program would not function correctly.
This problem should now be fixed, enabling the program to work
with and without HTTP proxy support on more systems.

This version should now also work on systems that use multiple
proxies for different protocols.

Translations
------------
The French translation had problems on some systems whereby
the user interface of the program was appearing blank (no text
labels were being shown at all). Obviously this made the program
rather more difficult to use! Thanks to a diagnosis by Jean-Bruno
Luginbühl, the French translation should now be working properly
again. (Note, this may have been affecting some Greek users too.)


===================
v0.9.3.1 - 2002/06/23

This version is a small update to DictInstall; there are no significant new
features. However, the program now includes two new translations
(Dutch and Italian), and will now allow multiple dictionaries to be installed
for a single language/country. This allows for the inclusion of the Latin
dictionary ... however, there are still bugs with detection of multiple
dictionaries for a single locale.

The biggest change and the reason for this small release is that the
program should now work with the changes introduced in OpenOffice.org
1.0.1 -- without this release, DictInstall would not work at all with
the new version. If anyone has any problems using DictInstall with 
OpenOffice.org 1.0.1, please get in touch. However, as yet, there is
no support for shared dictionaries; DictInstall can only install single
user dictionaries at the moment.

I hope to make a bigger release with a number of bug fixes and a couple
of new features fairly soon.


===================
v0.9.3 - 2002/05/23

New features:
============
Proxy server support - this version contains initial support for HTTP proxy
servers. This has been tested on my network -- I'd really appreciate
further reports (both failures and successes!) with proxy servers from
anyone who is able to test this.

Translations - as well as English and German, DictInstall now has
translations for French, Spanish, Danish, Finnish and Greek. Many thanks
to all those who contributed to these. I had to make some changes
(including a couple of hacks) to get the Greek alphabet to work, and
hope to improve on the way this has been done in a later version.

Help file - there is now an initial help file (help.html) which will be
expanded in time to form a manual. It contains information on setting
up DictInstall in local mode and with a proxy server. (Note to translators:
I don't recommend that this be translated yet as it is likely to be
changed quite a lot in future versions.)

Bug fixes
=========
DictInstall should now run successfully even if called from another
directory. This should facilitate its use on CD-ROMs when called from
a launcher.

Other bug fixes I have forgotten about. :-)

Known issues
============
There are still problems with "double dictionaries"; the two Greek
dictionaries for example. I have not yet dealt with these as I am
having to make a few changes to the program to support the
Latin dictionary and this should sort those issues out.


===================
v0.9.2 - 2002/05/03

New features:
============
No major new features: the program now shows the OpenOffice.org
installation folder though, even if it only finds one installation.

Bug fixes
=========
Fixed a bug which appeared to affect single user Win9x users
(possibly only Win95), whereby downloading the dictionary list
was repeated endlessly.

Fixed a bug which was causing installation to fail when connecting
through some local area networks (well, mine!). This may fix problems
that some users have been having.

Updated the home page listed on the about box to the new
address: http://www.ooodocs.org/dictinstall/

Note
====
I am aware that many people are using DictInstall on machines
which are connected through a proxy server. It is my intention
to implement proxy support soon!


===================
v0.9.1 - 2002/04/28

New features:
============

German Translation
------------------
Huge thanks to Marco Huggenberger, who has now translated
DictInstall into German. Marco is also translating the web page 
and install guide.

Localisation
------------
With the new German translation, I've added locale detection (so 
if your PC is configured to use German, DictInstall should too.)
If anyone see's problems with this, please let me know.

Local Install mode
------------------
A number of changes have been made to enable "local install mode".
By making a couple of changes to the configuration, DictInstall will
take the dictionary zip files from a local folder. This enables its use
on a CD-ROM including a full set of dictionaries. If anyone needs
help on setting up a Local Install, please email me:
leecorbin@openoffice.org

Configuration
-------------
The program now stores user configuration in the user's registry 
and a cache of the dictionary file on the hard disk. This was done
to make Local Install mode possible, but has other advantages.
On multi-user systems, each user should now have their own
set of settings.


Bug fixes
=========

Improved handling of failed connections.

During non-cancellable operations, the window close box is
greyed out to prevent a crash. In the future, these operations
will be made cancellable!

Display problems: should now work with Large Fonts (note that
this is currently imperfect - the fonts are still small - but the
program is now usable). Hopefully this will solve the 'clipping'
problem too.

Plus many others!


Known issues
============

There are some problems still with "double dictionaries". That is,
language/country pairs which have multiple dictionaries. This
is currently seen with the Greek/Greek Enhanced dictionaries; for
example, there are problems when switching from one to the
other. Workaround: uninstall one Greek dictionary before 
attempting to install the other.


===================
v0.9.0 - 2002/04/24
First public version!
