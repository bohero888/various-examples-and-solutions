<h1><b>The OpenOffice.org Dictionary Installer</b><br />Help</h1>

<p>
	This is the provisional help file for the OpenOffice.org Dictionary Installer. It currently
	contains information on setting up DictInstall for local mode, and with proxy servers.
	I hope to expand it soon to make it a full "manual" for the program.
</p>

<h2>Local Mode</h2>
<p>
	DictInstall can be run in a "local install mode". This allows dictionaries to be
	installed from a hard disk rather than over the Internet. This could be particularly useful
	for CD-ROM maintainers who wish to provide the Dictionary Installer
	with all dictionaries as part of their CDs.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Setting up local mode</b>
	<br />To set up local mode, it is necessary to download all the dictionaries and place
	them (as zip files) into a local folder. The dictionaries can be downloaded from
	<a href="http://whiteboard.openoffice.org/lingucomponent/download_dictionary.html">
	the OpenOffice.org web site</a>. I recommend that they be placed in a folder
	<b>local</b> which is placed inside the DictInstall folder, though other locations
	are possible. (DictInstall already supports relative path names for this folder, and
	full support for absolute path names is being considered.)
</p>
<p>
	You will also need to download a dictionary list
	file for each language that you wish to support (here are the current
	<a href="http://www.ooodocs.org/dictinstall/dict.txt">English</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.ooodocs.org/dictinstall/de/dict.txt">German</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.ooodocs.org/dictinstall/da/dict.txt">Danish</a> and
	<a href="http://www.ooodocs.org/dictinstall/fi/dict.txt">Finnnish</a> lists).
	Note that you can download just one if you wish and use it for all languages. Once
	you have downloaded the dictionary lists, place them in the same directory as the
	dictionary zip files.
</p>
<p>
	Assuming that you now have a folder called <b>local</b> inside the DictInstall
	folder, you now need to make a few changes to the configuration file
	<b>dictinstall.ini</b>. Under <b>[config]</b> there are two lines in the file like this:
	<pre>
	#localpath=local\
	#locallist=dict.txt
	</pre>
	You will need to remove the hash symbols. This will cause the program to look
	in the <b>localpath</b> folder (in this case <b>local\</b>) and read the dictionary
	list (in this case <b>dict.txt</b>) provided there.
</p>

<p>
	If you choose to download dictionary lists for multiple languages, then you will
	need to point to each of those lists. For example, if you downloaded both
	English and German <b>dict.txt</b> files, you will need to rename one of them
	and put its name into the <b>dictinstall.ini</b> file. If you renamed the
	German one to <b>dict.de.txt</b>, then you would need to add the line <b>
	locallist=dict.de.txt</b> to the German (<b>[de]</b>) section of the configuration file:
	<pre>
	[de]
	listurl=http://www.ooodocs.org/dictinstall/de/dict.txt
	nexthelp=http://www.ooodocs.org/dictinstall/de/nexthelp.html
	locallist=dict.de.txt
	</pre>
	In fact, in the current version, the line is provided as an example, so you need
	only remove the hash from the front of this line too.
</p>

<p>
	When you now run the Dictionary Installer, it will look inside the folder you 
	specified and see if there is a dictionary list there. If so, the program should
	then install dictionaries directly from that folder. Please note that if the program
	is unable to find the dictionary list in the location specified, it will revert to
	its usual mode and download the list and dictionaries over the Internet.
</p>

<p>
	If you have any questions or problems getting local installation mode to work,
	please <a href="mailto:leecorbin@openoffice.org">email me</a>.
</p>

<h2>Proxy servers</h2>

<p>
	From version 0.9.3, DictInstall supports the use of HTTP proxy servers. This
	should allow the program to be used on many networks where it was previously
	unable. Note that at this point, proxy support is fairly untested: <b>all positive
	and negative feedback on this feature is greatly appreicated</b>.
</p>

<p>
	If you are using an HTTP proxy for your web browsing, and you use
	Internet Explorer, the program will hopefully work with your proxy server
	transparently. When it is run, it finds your Internet Explorer settings and tries
	to use them.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not use Internet Explorer, or if you are having problems with this,
	you will need to set up proxy manually. To do this, you will need to change
	one line in the configuration file <b>dictinstall.ini</b>.
	<pre>
	proxy=auto
	</pre>
	When set to <b>auto</b>, the program looks for Internet Explorer proxy
	settings and uses those. If you have had any problems with this and want to
	turn off proxy use altogether, change this line to say:
	<pre>
	proxy=off
	</pre>
	If you are using another browser or want to set proxy settings manually, then
	you should change this line to contain the server and port number of your
	server. For example, if your proxy server is on the computer <b>myproxy</b>
	and port <b>8000</b>, then you would change the line to say:
	<pre>
	proxy=myproxy:8000
	</pre>
</p>

<p>
	If you have any comments or have been having any problems with the
	proxy server feature, please <a href="mailto:leecorbin@openoffice.org">
	send me an email</a>.
