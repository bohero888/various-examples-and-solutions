InterAppComm demos

The following demos are distributed with InterAppComm:

* SenderReceiver - Consists of two projects; one a sender, the other a receiver.
                   Demonstrates how to communicate between two different applications
                   and hopefully gives an idea how to use the events of the sender 
                   and the receiver components.

* Instances      - Demonstrates how to communicate between two instances of the same
                   application. The application is both a sender and a receiver.
