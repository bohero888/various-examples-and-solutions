This demo demonstrates communication between the InterAppSender and 
InterAppReceiver components. A sender can send a call to all running 
Windows applications. Those containg a receiver component will reply.

Try having one or two sender apps. and two receiver apps. open at the
same time. You will see how the senders can send data to the receivers,
and how the receivers can respond to the senders through events.
