How to install the components
-----------------------------

*** YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE COMPONENTS BEFORE OPENING THE DEMOS IN DELPHI OR BCB. ***


1. Select "Install Component" from the "Component" menu item (may vary
   depending on your Delphi version).

2. A dialog displays where you must select the components to install and
   the package to install into. I recommend creating a new package, if you
   haven't already done so, rather than installing into the default package.

3. Browse for the InterAppComm.pas file and select OK.

4. That's it. The components should be visible in the component palette
   in a tab called "InterAppComm".
