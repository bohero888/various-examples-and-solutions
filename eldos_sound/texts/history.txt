+ Multiple ESP support: all supported files format can be opened.

All modules:

* Removed some guest files.
* Renamed some files.

ELAMP:

* added DirectSound const in audio.cpp

WMAMP:

-- 16 Dec 1999. bug-fix 3 (v1.08).

ElAMP:

* Seeking in imCallback mode fixed.
* ID3V2 support fixed (now should correctly process all ID3V2-compliant tag
headers. tested on all available ID3V2 streams. This means "not tested" :).
* The last second of any stream was not played. Fixed. 
* Annoying click at the beginning of the second song playback fixed!
  (Fk. This is a dirty hack, not a fix at all. But at least it works... :)
* Volume adjustment in omDirectSound fixed.

Well, there are no more known bugs left in ElAMP.  


-- 25 Nov 1999. bug-fix 2 (v1.07). 

ElAMP, WAVMP:

* changing playback position greatly improved.


-- 3 Aug 1999. bug-fix 1 (v1.06).

Component:

+ Callbacks handling improved. 

ElAMP:

* Fixed the "bug" when the execution halted on some lsf streams.
* fixed the bug when restarting playback after wav output.


-- 28 July 1999. Version 1.0 Release

All modules:

! OnOutput event is invoked twice per buffer - first time, when the buffer 
  is sent to mmSystem, and second time when the buffer is returned by mmSystem

* OnOutput* events are invoked for all output modes, and in correct order.
* Some memory leaks removed

ElAMP:

* Fixed the bug, that caused an error with large buffers
* Fixed(?) the bug when only half of some VBR streams is played.


-- 30 June 1999. Version 1.0 beta 6 (pre-release)

Component:

! Changed the declaration of OnInputSeek event. Now the event handler 
  SHOULD return the current position in the stream (this is used to
  prevent players from stopping when seeking VBR streams).

All modules:

* Fixed(?) the bug with some strange PCI cards, when the player crashed
  after the playback stop. 
* Fixed the bug that prevented the module from initializing when OLE system
  was already initialized before the module is loaded.

ElAMP:

* Fixed the bug with files, that have ID3v2 header.
! Now 48KHz streams are downsampled to 24KHz when being played to MMSystem
  (not downsampled when being played to other output). Say thanks to Billy :(.
  This allows the module to play 48KHz to MMSystem (in earlier betas it was
  not possible to play these files at all).

// BUGS:

- custom downsampling (for ex. 48000 to 44100) doesn't work. If someone helps
  me to fix the bug, or rewrites this downsampling at all, it would be so cool.
                                                                 

-- 18 Jun 1999. Version 1.0 beta 5

ElAMP:

* VBR streams are played fine
* streams made with AudioCatalyst are played fine
* streams with RIFF header are almost always played fine (see bugs section).

// BUGS:
- on some computers RIFF-headered files are not played. On my computer these
  exact streams are played fine. So if anyone will experience this problem,
  please, help me to fix the bug.

WMAMP:

* EndPos processing fixed (actually it is made working)
